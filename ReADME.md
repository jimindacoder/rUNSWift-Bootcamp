Accessing team code for:
  Task 2: Make the robot head follow the ball
          filename: HeadtrackBall.py
                    - Can be found in image->home/nao->data->behaviours->head->HeadtrackBall.py. Main Head skills also modified :)

  Task 4: Make the robot walk up to a ball, circle around it, point at it, and say “I found the ball!” (30 points)
          filename: CirclePointSpeak.py
                    - Can be found in image->home/nao->data->behaviours->body->skills-> CirclePointSpeak.py

  note: for the sorta transition part we asked the robot to track theball as soon as it synced and to start doing tasks when it gets unpenalised. 

Jimin and Khan did the dance section and I(myint) did task2 and attempted task 4 😊.
